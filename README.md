# 🧰 TreeFS

A powerful CLI toolkit to build and export directory structures from **tree text**, **YAML**, **JSON**, or **TOML** configs — with support for templates, Git initialization, and cross-platform release binaries.

Originally inspired by a tiny Bash script, TreeFS has grown into a full-featured Python project that helps automate project scaffolding and structure generation.
